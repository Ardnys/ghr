//! A cross-process advisory lock serializing binto's state/manifest read-modify-write sections.
//!
//! Without it, two concurrent `binto` processes both `load()` the old file, mutate their own
//! in-memory copy, and `save()` — the second to write clobbers the first's entry (a lost update),
//! and both racing on the shared `*.toml.tmp` temp file can corrupt it. The lock is held only for
//! the brief mutation (never across a download), so concurrent installs still run their slow work
//! in parallel and merely serialize their writes.
